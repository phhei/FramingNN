855|27|principles|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""I agree that there's something ugly about the police asking citizens for their 'papers.' (There's nothing particularly ugly about asking illegal immigrants for their papers, though.) There's also something ugly about American citizens being physically searched at airports, or about IRS agents prying into nearly all of your personal-financial transactions or, thanks to the passage of ObamaCare, serving as health insurance enforcers. In other words, many government functions are unappealing. That's not in itself an argument against them. The Patriot Act was ugly – and necessary."""|Pro|Arizona immigration law awkward, but necessary

861|145|reasonable suspicion|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""[Argument:] 'Reasonable suspicion' is a meaningless term that will permit police misconduct. [Counter-argument:] Over the past four decades, federal courts have issued hundreds of opinions defining those two words. The Arizona law didn’t invent the concept: Precedents list the factors that can contribute to reasonable suspicion; when several are combined, the 'totality of circumstances' that results may create reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. [...] For example, the Arizona law is most likely to come into play after a traffic stop. A police officer pulls a minivan over for speeding. A dozen passengers are crammed in. None has identification. The highway is a known alien-smuggling corridor. The driver is acting evasively.

Actually, Section 2 provides that a law enforcement official “may not solely consider race, color or national origin” in making any stops or determining immigration status. In addition, all normal Fourth Amendment protections against profiling will continue to apply.

Yet at a news conference, she was unable to answer the question 'What does an illegal immigrant look like?' If she doesn't know, how are police to know? Because Arizona's law offers no guidance as to what constitutes a 'reasonable suspicion' that someone is undocumented, police will likely resort to profiling of Latinos on an unprecedented level. Isn't Goldberg outraged by these apparent violations of the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable search and seizure? Or of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause?

It takes a measured, reasonable step to give Arizona police officers another tool when they come into contact with illegal aliens during their normal law enforcement duties."""|Pro|Arizona law is reasonable, measured response to illegal immigration

875|41|feasibility|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""The government of Arizona, it turns out, has been ambushed by its own legislature. If this vague law is applied vigorously, the state will be regularly sued by citizens who are wrongfully stopped. But if the law is not applied vigorously enough, it contains a provision allowing citizens to sue any agency or official who 'limits or restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws.' Either way, lawyers rejoice."""|Con|Arizona immigration law will increase lawsuits and costs

877|38|deterrence|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|Although conventional wisdom presumes that a prohibitory law will have the desired effect, careful studies of law often show the opposite effect: the behavior they are supposed to inhibit actually increases.

Cracking down on illegal immigrants will, therefore, have a positive effect in reducing crime rates in Arizona.|Pro|The new immigration law will decrease crime rates in Arizona.
879|62|crime|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|In general, the absence of the enforcement of immigration laws in Arizona creates a sense of anarchy in the state, and a certain feeling among criminals that they can commit crimes without concern for punishment.|Pro|Arizona law represents a much needed step away from anarchy.
880|62|crime|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""One of the concrete problems with the law treating undocumented immigrants as criminals is that it gives those without papers a powerful incentive to stay as far away from police as possible. This will only make it more difficult for local police to investigate crimes and track down fugitive offenders, because no potential witness who is undocumented will come forward."""|Con|Arizona law causes distrust of police, undermines enforcement
881|62|crime|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|"Joel Jacobsen, assistant attorney general, criminal appeals division for New Mexico: ""This obviously puts police in an impossible situation because it requires them to pursue two goals simultaneously: to enforce the immigration laws; and to enforce the criminal laws, keep the peace, provide assistance, and all the other ordinary tasks of police officers. Which goal should they pursue? It will frequently not be possible to do both, because the officer will be required to arrest perpetrator and victim both, and the punishment experienced by the victim of a violent crime will frequently be more severe and life-disrupting – deportation – than that experienced by the perpetrator – a night in jail, perhaps."""|Con|Arizona law puts police under contradicting missions
882|148|state rights|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""[Myth:] State governments aren’t allowed to get involved in immigration, which is a federal matter. [Counter-argument:] While it is true that Washington holds primary authority in immigration, the Supreme Court since 1976 has recognized that states may enact laws to discourage illegal immigration without being pre-empted by federal law. As long as Congress hasn’t expressly forbidden the state law in question, the statute doesn’t conflict with federal law and Congress has not displaced all state laws from the field, it is permitted.

Many believe this amendment applies to the creation and enforcement of immigration law, in particular because it is a criminal issue.|Pro|10th amendment supports state rights to craft immigration law.
885|148|state rights|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""Arizona's law might give the nation information about whether judicious enforcement discourages illegality. If so, it is a worthwhile experiment in federalism."" In other words, the feasibility and efficacy of a law such as Arizona's is not entirely known yet, and so Arizona provides an very valuable test case to determine these things."""|Pro|Arizona's immigration law is good test case for nation
886|148|state rights|81| Arizona illegal immigration law|": ""TAKE BACK IMMIGRATION POLICY The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that states cannot make their own immigration laws.

Regrettably, most American citizens are not fully aware of the illegal immigration crisis this country is experiencing. Any notion of a mass amnesty is foolish and will only worsen the problem, encouraging more aliens to enter the United States illegally and further reward those who have already violated our laws.

They typically lead productive and law-abiding lives consistent with American ideals. Their only illegal action was entering the United States. As such, efforts should be made to integrate them into American society, and providing them the option of obtaining driver's licenses is a good way of achieving this.|Yes|Illegal immigrants in America should be integrated into society
4492|64|social|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|It is not possible to deport between 10 and 12 million illegal immigrants. Therefore, integration is the best option.

4493|64|social|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|Sending millions of illegal immigrants back to their home countries would result in a humanitarian crisis, particularly in Mexico.

4494|64|social|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|The primary basis for this argument is that illegal immigrants are, inherently, in the United States illegally. On a purely legal basis, they should not be afforded legal documentation such as a driver's license, and should be deported. Beyond the legality, many argue that the presence of illegal immigrants is harmful economically and socially to lawful citizens, providing additional cause to moving away from integration and such measures as providing illegal immigrants with driver's licenses.|No|Illegal immigrants should not be integrated into American society, but rather deported.

But, what about other groups of illegal immigrants that may be ""less desirable""? What about an illegal immigrant from, for example, Iran? The problem is that the proposition tends to base its arguments off of only one particular group of illegal immigrants (Mexican immigrants constituted around 57% of the illegal immigrant population in 2007), while seemingly denying the costs of accepting other groups of illegal immigrants into this program."|No|Driver's licenses would have to be offered to ALL illegal immigrants (not just Mexican)
4496|359|legality|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|"- The fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868 to secure rights for slaves, holds that states must provide equal protection under the law to all persons (not only to citizens) within their jurisdictions. Section 1 of the fourteenth amendment holds, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" The case Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), saw the Supreme Court of the United States strike down a state statute denying funding for education to children who were illegal immigrants. It established that regardless of legal status, illegal immigrants are still 'persons' and thus protected as such under some provisions the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution, notably the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This precedent has been interpreted to mean that illegal immigrants should also enjoy equal protection in regard to access to driver's licenses."|Yes|Illegal immigrants enjoy equal protection under US law
4497|359|legality|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|Offering drivers licenses to illegal immigrants provides legal status to individuals that have knowingly broken US laws. The Immigration and Nationality Act clearly states that illegal aliens should be deported. These long-standing laws must be upheld. Offering illegal immigrants driver's licenses clearly violates these laws and the impression that the United States is capable of enforcing them. It also undermines the notion of rewarding law abiding citizens and punishing those that break the law. Why should illegal immigrants be allowed to get away with their illegal acts. US citizens (not illegal aliens) are not afforded this luxury of forgiveness in the face of the law. Therefore, the proposition is an unwarranted and immoral concession that undermines the consistency of US law.|No|Offering illegal immigrants driver's licenses would violate the rule of law
4498|359|legality|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- Criminals cannot be trusted to respect US laws.

4507|29|national security|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- Driver's licenses are not the end-all-be-all of identity in the United States. Illegal immigrants are effectively faking passports, driver's licenses, and other items of identification.

4508|29|national security|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- Many terrorists, including 9/11 terrorists, obtained driver's licenses as a means to perform their acts of terrorism. They used driver's licenses to move more freely around the United States, and to get onto the airplanes that were used in the 9/11 attacks. Driver's licenses, therefore, are a primary tool for terrorists or any individual that may pose a national security threat of some kind. While illegal immigrants should not generally be viewed as terrorists or national security threats, the poor background information on them, that they are foreign in origin, and that they illegally crossed a national boundary may make them more likely terrorists suspects than other groups. This should lead America to the conclusion that offering illegal immigrants driver's licenses poses national security risks.|No|Offering illegal immigrants drivers licenses is a national security threat
4509|29|national security|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- Passport security has been substantially improved.

4513|635|stemming immigration|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|In the United States, there are uncertainties regarding the future of illegal immigrants.

4514|635|stemming immigration|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|Any incentive offered to illegal aliens to obtain driver's licenses risks being viewed as a reward or concession for illegal behavior. This is wrong.|No|It would be wrong to provide illegal aliens an incentive to obtain driver's licenses.
4515|635|stemming immigration|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- A big part of solving the illegal immigration problem is creating dis-incentives for entering the United States. This is one of the reasons why pressure is being put on employers to stop hiring illegal aliens. Yet, driver's licenses for illegal aliens will provide a significant spur to future illegal immigration. It will be a signal that the United States is willing to accept, accommodate, and integrate illegal aliens. In this way, the proposition is detrimental to the effort to reduce illegal immigration. Given the fact that the United States suffers from the largest illegal immigration problem in the world, this is a major problem with offering driver's licenses to illegal immigrants in the United States.|No|Offering driver's licenses to illegal immigrants will incentivize more illegal immigration
4516|635|stemming immigration|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- If America really wanted to uncover and deport illegal immigrants it could. It is generally capable of enforcing immigration laws, making it wrong to view illegal immigrant driver's licenses as the only remaining alternative.|No|America is capable of enforcing immigration law

If illegal aliens had driver's licenses, obtained the necessary driving instruction, and also qualified for insurance, then the general risk on roads would be dramatically reduced, along with insurance costs for everyone.|Yes|Driver's licenses for illegal immigrants will generally lower insurance costs
4518|0|economics|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- Some argue that illegal immigrants should be deported, rather than provided legal licenses that further integrate them into society. The problem with this approach, however, is that it would withdraw from society the substantial contributions (economic and other) being made by illegal immigrants. The costs would be prohibitively high. Therefore, efforts to integrate illegal immigrants are necessary, including providing them with driver's licenses.|Yes|Deporting illegal immigrants would cripple the US economy
4519|0|economics|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|While driver's licenses for illegal immigrants may reduce general insurance costs, it will raise costs in other ways.

4521|636|dmv employees|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- While determining illegal immigrant status may be difficult, systems have been created to enable this. One such system is called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system, where DMV employees would simply have to enter the document number and the name of the bearer into the computer and wait for an answer from state and federal government officials. This means that DMV employees would not need to become immigration experts.|No|DMV employees would not need to become immigration experts to determine the illegality of an immigrant
4522|637|voter fraud|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|Voter fraud is only possible if an illegal alien is able to pretend that they are legal citizens with their driver's license.

Such an interpretation should stand above public opinion.|Yes|Public opinion is irrelevant to legal/constitutional interpretations on providing driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.
4526|638|american opinion|487| Drivers licenses for Illegal immigrants in the US|- Public opposition to this proposition is a very important fact to consider. This is an issue that deeply affects the public and which is based on public values.

Yet, are they really freely making this choice? Many supporters of a smoking ban posit that a job is not something that is easily replaceable. There are many factors that may limit a workers ability to freely shift jobs like 1)Job-markets are tight. 2)A worker's family depends on a worker's income from a job. 3)The time (and therefore money) required of an employee to find another job is limited. 4)Other job opportunities are less lucrative (frequently the case in service industries such as bars, clubs, and restaurants), and so the ability or reasoned-impetus to ""choose"" a different job is heavily constrained."|Yes|Many workers can't simply quite an unhealthy, smoky work environment.

Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. Most argue that people should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking.

If smoking was a less social activity, fewer people would start smoking. In many countries, governments pay all or some of the cost of treating smoking-related diseases.

1864|307|smoking quantities|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Heavy smokers are unlikely to give up since they are addicted to nicotine. Banning smoking in public will, therefore, only encourage people to smoke more at home. This will harm other people in their houses, particularly children. This is important, since children are not old enough to choose freely to smoke passively. Also, people smoking at home may drink more alcohol than they would if they went to a bar. This is because they can buy it more cheaply at a supermarket or off-license. Drinking more alcohol may lead to other health problems.|No|Banning smoking in public would cause people to smoke more at home.

11909|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|With little doubt that smoking is harmful to individuals, governments should take actions to protect its citizens and ban smoking. There is little doubt that smoking tobacco is extremely harmful to the smoker's health. In the US, for example, research by the American Cancer Society suggests that tobacco causes up to 400,000 deaths each year - more than AIDS, alcohol, drug abuse, car crashes, murders, suicides, and fires combined. Smoking is the single biggest cause of avoidable death in the EU as 0.5 mil. people die due to smoking annually in the 27 member bloc alone (this figure rises to over 1mil. deaths in Europe as a whole). World-wide some 3 million people die from smoking each year - one every ten seconds - which estimates suggest will rise to 10 million by 2020. Smokers are up to 22 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, and smoking can lead to a host of other health problems, including emphysema and heart disease.One of the main responsibilities of any government is to ensure the safety of its population; that is why taking hard drugs and breaking the speed limit are also illegal. It would therefore be reasonable to ban smoking - an activity which kills millions of people each year.|Yes|Cigarettes are harmful; governments should take action against them.
11910|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|In fact, recent allegations suggest that tobacco companies deliberately produce the most addictive cigarettes they can. Up to 90% of smokers begin when they are below the age of 18, often due to peer pressure; once addicted, continuing to smoke is no longer an issue of freedom of choice, but of chemical compulsion. Like other addictive drugs such as heroin and cocaine, tobacco should be banned since this is the only way to force people to quit.|Yes|Smoking is not a real choice, as nicotine is an addictive drug:
11911|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|Most smokers say that they want to quit, so further restriction or a ban on tobacco would be doing them a favor. In work places, where smoking is banned, the proportion of daily smokers drops by 22% and their awerage consumption drops by 5 cigarettes per day.|Yes|Most smokers want to quit; restrictions do them a favor.
11912|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|While a government has a responsibility to protect its population, it also has a responsibility to defend their freedom of choice. The law steps in to prevent citizens causing harm to others, whether deliberately or accidentally. However, it should not stop them taking risks themselves - for example, dangerous sports such as rock-climbing, parachuting or motor-racing are legal. It is also legal to indulge in other health-threatening activities such as eating lots of fatty foods, taking no exercise, and drinking too much alcohol. Banning smoking would be an unmerited intrusion into personal freedom.|No|Governments must defend freedom of choice to smoke.
11913|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|Tobacco is not debilitating in the same way that many illegal narcotics may be, nor is it comparable to the likes of heroin in terms of addictiveness, nor is it a mind-altering substance that leads to irrational, violent, or criminal behaviour. In this sense it is much less harmful than e.g. alcohol. The fact that so many smokers give up every year is testament to this.|No|A comparison of tobacco to hard drugs is inaccurate:
11914|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|Addiction shouldn't be the major criteria for banning tobacco consumption, because other acceptable products are addictive. Coffee and physical exercise can both be considered addictive, but neither would be considered appropriate for being made illegal on this basis. For this reason, addictiveness should not be a main criteria in the legal considerations of this debate.|No|Many things are addictive; alienating tobacco is unfair.
11915|1390|corporate responsibility|1528| Smoking|If a company produces food that is poisonous or a car that fails safety tests, the product is immediately taken off the market. Since all cigarettes and other tobacco products are poisonous and potentially lethal, they should all be taken off the market. In short, smoking should be banned.|Yes|Cigarette makers should pay a price for creating harmful products.
11916|1390|corporate responsibility|1528| Smoking|As the proposition points out, cigarettes are not dangerous because they are defective; rather they are inherently, potentially, harmful. Cigarette companies are, therefore, not failing their consumers by producing cigarettes; the consumers are getting what they asked for. The individual's right to choose a certain effect is not being infringed upon, as it is when a certain good fails. Therfore, people should still be allowed to choose to buy and smoke them.|No|Cigarettes are very different from dangerous cars or poisonous foods:
11917|1390|corporate responsibility|1528| Smoking|High cholesterol or a high intake of fat can be extremely harmful, leading to heart disease, obesity, and other conditions; but manufacturers of these products are not punished. Consumers simply like the taste of fatty food. People should be allowed to smoke cigarettes and to eat fatty foods - both these things are sources of pleasure which, while having serious associated health risks, are only fatal after many decades, unlike a poisonous food or an unsafe car, which pose immediate and high risks.|No|Many products are unhealthy; alienating cigarettes is unfair.
11918|41|feasibility|1528| Smoking|It would be unreasonable to criminalize an activity indulged in by about one sixth of the world population. The lesson of prohibition of alcohol in America in the 1920s was that banning a recreational drug used by a large proportion of the population merely leads to crime and contraband. It would also mean that governments would lose tax revenue from tobacco sales - a major source of income for national health and other resources in many countries.|No|Restricting smoking, done by billions of people, is unreasonable.
11919|1391|harming to others|1528| Smoking|In a smoke-filled environment, non-smokers (family members, colleagues, customers, etc.) are also exposed to the risks associated with tobacco. Research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer, even if they do not use tobacco products. It is estimated that passive smoking kills approximately 80 000 people in the EU alone every year. (Brussels estimates that 15% of all deaths in the EU could be attributed to smoking.) Beyond the health risks, smoke can also be extremely unpleasant in public spaces, in the workplace or in bars and restaurants. (Data indicates that almost 86% of EU citizens are in favor of a ban on smoking at work.) Smokers are therefore causing discomfort - as well as actual harm - to others. On top of the harm cause to the smokers themselves, this is surely enough reason to ban smoking.|Yes|Smoking forces others to 'passively smoking':
11920|1391|harming to others|1528| Smoking|Few controlled studies having been carried out. At most, those who live with heavy smokers for a long period of time may have a very slightly increased risk of cancer.|No|"Evidence about ""passive smoking"" is dubious."
11921|1391|harming to others|1528| Smoking|It is true that smoke-filled environments can be unpleasant for non-smokers, but there are reasonable and responsible ways around this - smoking rooms in offices and airports are an excellent example. Some bars and restaurants may choose to be non-smoking establishments, giving customers the choice to select their environment. Allowing people to make their own, adult decisions is surely always the best option. Restricting smoking in public places may sometimes be appropriate, banning it altogether would be excessive.|No|"""Passive smoking"" can be reduced without draconian restrictions."
11923|1392|tobacco ads|1528| Smoking|There should be a ban on all tobacco advertising due to the knowledge of its ill effects.|Yes|Harm of cigarettes are cause enough for restrictions on ads.
11924|1392|tobacco ads|1528| Smoking|There is no good evidence that either of these measures would have an impact on the rate of tobacco consumption. Cigarette companies claim that advertisements are merely to persuade people to switch brands, not to start smoking in the first place. People start smoking through peer pressure - indeed the more of a 'forbidden fruit' cigarettes become, the more attractive they will be to adolescents. As for health warnings, if the knowledge that cigarettes have serious health risks deterred people from smoking then no-one would smoke any more. People start and continue to smoke in the full knowledge of the health risks.|No|Ads do not force people to smoke.
11925|1393|tobacco anti-adverts|1528| Smoking|According to one of the largest neuromarketing studies ever conducted (see the book Buyology or its websites), adverts stating harmfulness of smoking and emphasizing health risks are in fact counterproductive - they effectively activate those parts of brain that trigger craving for cigarettes.

If you examine what happens in many animal species, especially displays of dominance in other primate species, dominance displays often have sexual overtones. When, for example, in many species of primates, a subordinate male is faced with aggression by a dominant male, the dominant male will bite the subordinate, causing him to squeal in pain, drop the food (or the female) and present his rump. This is an act of submission, and it is saying to the whole troupe that the subordinate is just that - subordinate.

The stereotype has it that gays are promiscuous, unable to form lasting relationships, and the relationships that do form are shallow and uncommitted. And gays do have such relationships! [...] But the important fact to note is that just like in straight society, where such relationships also exist, they are a small minority, and exist primarily among the very young. Indeed, one of the most frequent complaints of older gay men is that it is almost impossible to find quality single men to get into a relationship with, because they're already all 'taken!'

It's probable that it means the same thing earlier, when the citizens of Sodom ask Lot to bring out his guests so they may 'know' them. Lot accuses them of acting wickedly--an odd charge if all they meant is that they wanted to interrogate them to discover if they were spies. The biblical echoes of the Sodom story, furthermore, all clearly refer to sexual sin. Jeremiah 49:18 criticizes Jerusalem for its sexual sin, and says it is like Sodom. Ezekiel 16:49 is sometimes cited to prove that the sin of Sodom was only inhospitality. But the next verse says the residents of Sodom were destroyed because they did 'abominable things before me.'
