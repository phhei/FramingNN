1845|303|workers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|"Opponents of a ban often argue that employees at smoking institutions can simply get another job at a non-smoking institution, and thus such workers are voluntarily subjecting themselves to being ""passive smokers"". Yet, are they really freely making this choice? Many supporters of a smoking ban posit that a job is not something that is easily replaceable. There are many factors that may limit a workers ability to freely shift jobs like 1)Job-markets are tight. 2)A worker's family depends on a worker's income from a job. 3)The time (and therefore money) required of an employee to find another job is limited. 4)Other job opportunities are less lucrative (frequently the case in service industries such as bars, clubs, and restaurants), and so the ability or reasoned-impetus to ""choose"" a different job is heavily constrained."|Yes|Many workers can't simply quite an unhealthy, smoky work environment.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1846|303|workers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|It can be argued that, if a worker objects to inhaling second hand smoke involuntarily at their work place, that they can choose to work somewhere else. There are many careers that people choose to partake in that involve substantial risk or inherent bodily or mental harm or strain.

1847|303|workers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|"Various forms of physical, mental, tangible, and less tangible forms of harm are frequently involved in the jobs that workers choose to perform. Yet, these harms are often accepted as meaningful sacrifices that workers are free to take-up when they deem these harms to be outweighed by the benefits of such employment. As long as their ability is maitained to calculate such benefits and costs and make a free ""choice"" to stick with such a job, then the arrangement could be argued as just. If workers in smoke-filled environments are free to make such calculations of costs and benefits, then it can be argued that their arrangement is fair, and that cigarette bans in such public environments should not be required on this basis."|No|Smoky work environments are not different that other harmful lines of work.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1848|248|choice|166| Ban on smoking in public places|In many places, there are no non-smoking bars or restaurants. Unless people refuse to go out with friends who smoke, they cannot avoid passive smoking. People who work in smoky workplaces like bars often do not freely choose this and sometimes there are no other jobs are available for them. In most countries, safety standards do not allow workers to be exposed to unnecessary danger, even if they agree. Workers should not be exposed to other people’s smoke, since they may not have made a free choice to do so.|Yes|Is it wrong to say that people choose to smoke passively.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1849|248|choice|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Society accepts that adults can decide to harm themselves to some extent, so long as they do not harm others. This is why the proposition is not arguing that people should be banned from smoking in private. Passive smokers do choose to breathe in other people’s smoke. If they do not want to smoke passively, they do not need to go to places where smoking is allowed. There is therefore no reason to ban smoking in public.|No|People can leave smoking areas to avoid harm.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1850|248|choice|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Non-smoking bars are rare in the United States. This suggests that culture is accepting of people who smoke in bars. It is the norm for Americans to drink beer and smoke. Most people who go to bars must not mind smoke that much. If they did, they would not go. While for some non-smokers, the presence of smoke may be bothersome, but it is usually not a dealbreaker.|No|The demand for non-smoking bars has been low.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1851|248|choice|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Workers should be allowed to choose to work in dangerous conditions. This is accepted for jobs like mining, fishing and the armed forces. Individuals decide that they are better doing this work than not having a job at all.|No|Workers are free to choose to quit a smoky, unhealthy working environment.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1852|248|choice|166| Ban on smoking in public places|A person should have a choice to go into a non-smoking restaurant or a non-smoking section of a restaurant. It should remain optional. Restaurants are currently required by most states to require a non-smoking section. A ban would be unnecessary at this point.|No|A complete ban is not necessary to give people a choice.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1853|304|protecting non-smokers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Scientists have agreed that smoking is dangerous as tobacco smoke causes cancer, strokes and heart disease. Smoking does not just harm the smoker. It also harms people nearby, who breathe in the smoke. This kind of smoking is called passive smoking. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. Most argue that people should only be exposed to harm if they understand the risks and choose to accept them. A complete ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer, even if they do not use tobacco products. It is estimated that passive smoking kills approximately 80 000 people in the EU alone every year. (Brussels estimates that 15% of all deaths in the EU could be attributed to smoking.)|Yes|Public smoking ban protects health of non-smokers.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1854|304|protecting non-smokers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|One's freedom to swing one's fist ends where someone else's nose begins. Similarly, the right to smoke ends exactly where it comes into conflict with the lungs, nasal passages, and health of others. Public places are such a place and - for example - non-smokers account for 70% of EU population. Therefore, in order to maintain the rights of non-smokers, smoking in public places should be banned.|Yes|Public smoking ban protects rights of non-smokers.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1855|304|protecting non-smokers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Many smokers excuse their public smoking on the grounds that they don't have anywhere to smoke.

1857|304|protecting non-smokers|166| Ban on smoking in public places|There are plenty of places ware there is no smoking allowed, especially lately. You can't smoke at work, you cant smoke in bars and so it is getting harder and harder to find places to smoke in public. So I don't see why people are putting up a big fuss about the whole thing.|No|If you dont like smoking or smokers then just leave.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1858|305|odor|166| Ban on smoking in public places|The annoyance extends to a level of intrusion when considering the fact that cigarette smoke has the tendency to linger in ones clothing and hair, making it more personally disruptive to non-smokers than say, loud laughter or the bad body oder of another patron. Because, in this way, the offense is particularly intrusive into the lives of non-smokers, it may even be possible to consider such intrusions to be violations of certain liberties of non-smokers.|Yes|A ban will get rid of the odor left by cigarette smoke.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1859|305|odor|166| Ban on smoking in public places|A non-smoker who finds the smell of smoke unappealing should not be outraged by it. The smell of a particular scent is matter of opinion which should not be controlled by the administration.|No|Not all non-smokers find the smell of tobacco smoke unappealing.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1860|306|assisting quiting|166| Ban on smoking in public places|A ban would encourage smokers to smoke less or give up. If smoking was banned in public places, it would no longer be a social activity. Instead, smokers would have to leave their friends inside and go outside to smoke. This would be particularly unpleasant when it is cold or wet. One third of smokers in Scotland said the ban was helping them to cut down. If smoking was a less social activity, fewer people would start smoking. In many countries, governments pay all or some of the cost of treating smoking-related diseases. This means that governments should have a right to discourage smoking.|Yes|A smoking ban in public places alienates smokers and incentivizes quiting.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1861|306|assisting quiting|166| Ban on smoking in public places|In workplaces where smoking is banned, 18% of workers smoke daily and their averge consumption drops to 15.4 cigarettes per day. By contrast, when there are no bans, 40% of workers smoke daily and their average consumption is about 20.1 cigarette per day.|Yes|Consumption drops thanks to the ban.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1862|306|assisting quiting|166| Ban on smoking in public places|"Many groups argue that a government should not try and shape the social choices of its citizens toward desired social ends; people should be as free as possible to do what they want, as long as their actions don't violate the liberties of others. In this framework, governments should not intervene in the personal choice of a citizen to smoke - through a public places smoking ban - for any expressed purpose of affecting a ""positive"" change in that citizen's personal choices."|No|The government shouldn't play the role of Big Brother with a smoking ban.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1863|307|smoking quantities|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Smokers need to maintain a certain level of nicotine in their blood to remain content. A ban on smoking in public would force them to smoke less while at work. Over time, this would lower the level of nicotine they need to feel content. This would reduce how often they need to smoke. They would therefore smoke less at home, as well as less at work. Research suggests that in work places where smoking is banned, the proportion of daily smokers drops by 22% and their average consumption declines by 5 cigarettes per day.|Yes|A smoking ban will cause people to smoke less overall.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1864|307|smoking quantities|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Heavy smokers are unlikely to give up since they are addicted to nicotine. Banning smoking in public will, therefore, only encourage people to smoke more at home. This will harm other people in their houses, particularly children. This is important, since children are not old enough to choose freely to smoke passively. Also, people smoking at home may drink more alcohol than they would if they went to a bar. This is because they can buy it more cheaply at a supermarket or off-license. Drinking more alcohol may lead to other health problems.|No|Banning smoking in public would cause people to smoke more at home.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1865|307|smoking quantities|166| Ban on smoking in public places|"The problem is that many teenagers start smoking due to peer pressure or when there already is a smoker in their family.

1866|308|businesses|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Pubs and clubs should adapt, for example by trying to earn more money from selling food. After a ban was introduced in New South Wales (Australia), only 9% of restaurants reported a drop in trade.|Yes|It is more important to protect people’s health than to protect businesses.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1867|308|businesses|166| Ban on smoking in public places|Smokers will not go to non-smoking places. The claim that more non-smokers will visit bars and restaurants has been proved to be untrue. These businesses would also earn less money from selling tobacco. In many places, pubs and Working Men’s Clubs are important social places for communities. The smoking ban in the UK has had a devastating effect on the pub trade.|No|A smoking ban would drive many bars and restaurants out of business.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
1871|6|public opinion|166| Ban on smoking in public places|While 70% of Europeans are non-smokers, 86% are in favour of a ban on smoking at work, 84% in other public places, 61% in bars and pubs and 77% in restaurants.|Pro|Majority of Europeans support ban on smoking in public place.|PUBLIC OPINION|(PUBLIC OPINION:1.0)
11909|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|With little doubt that smoking is harmful to individuals, governments should take actions to protect its citizens and ban smoking. There is little doubt that smoking tobacco is extremely harmful to the smoker's health. In the US, for example, research by the American Cancer Society suggests that tobacco causes up to 400,000 deaths each year - more than AIDS, alcohol, drug abuse, car crashes, murders, suicides, and fires combined. Smoking is the single biggest cause of avoidable death in the EU as 0.5 mil. people die due to smoking annually in the 27 member bloc alone (this figure rises to over 1mil. deaths in Europe as a whole). World-wide some 3 million people die from smoking each year - one every ten seconds - which estimates suggest will rise to 10 million by 2020. Smokers are up to 22 times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, and smoking can lead to a host of other health problems, including emphysema and heart disease.One of the main responsibilities of any government is to ensure the safety of its population; that is why taking hard drugs and breaking the speed limit are also illegal. It would therefore be reasonable to ban smoking - an activity which kills millions of people each year.|Yes|Cigarettes are harmful; governments should take action against them.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11910|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|In fact, recent allegations suggest that tobacco companies deliberately produce the most addictive cigarettes they can. Up to 90% of smokers begin when they are below the age of 18, often due to peer pressure; once addicted, continuing to smoke is no longer an issue of freedom of choice, but of chemical compulsion. Like other addictive drugs such as heroin and cocaine, tobacco should be banned since this is the only way to force people to quit.|Yes|Smoking is not a real choice, as nicotine is an addictive drug:|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11911|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|Most smokers say that they want to quit, so further restriction or a ban on tobacco would be doing them a favor. In work places, where smoking is banned, the proportion of daily smokers drops by 22% and their awerage consumption drops by 5 cigarettes per day.|Yes|Most smokers want to quit; restrictions do them a favor.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11912|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|While a government has a responsibility to protect its population, it also has a responsibility to defend their freedom of choice. The law steps in to prevent citizens causing harm to others, whether deliberately or accidentally. However, it should not stop them taking risks themselves - for example, dangerous sports such as rock-climbing, parachuting or motor-racing are legal. It is also legal to indulge in other health-threatening activities such as eating lots of fatty foods, taking no exercise, and drinking too much alcohol. Banning smoking would be an unmerited intrusion into personal freedom.|No|Governments must defend freedom of choice to smoke.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11913|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|Tobacco is not debilitating in the same way that many illegal narcotics may be, nor is it comparable to the likes of heroin in terms of addictiveness, nor is it a mind-altering substance that leads to irrational, violent, or criminal behaviour. In this sense it is much less harmful than e.g. alcohol. The fact that so many smokers give up every year is testament to this.|No|A comparison of tobacco to hard drugs is inaccurate:|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11914|1389|protecting smokers|1528| Smoking|Addiction shouldn't be the major criteria for banning tobacco consumption, because other acceptable products are addictive. Coffee and physical exercise can both be considered addictive, but neither would be considered appropriate for being made illegal on this basis. For this reason, addictiveness should not be a main criteria in the legal considerations of this debate.|No|Many things are addictive; alienating tobacco is unfair.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11915|1390|corporate responsibility|1528| Smoking|If a company produces food that is poisonous or a car that fails safety tests, the product is immediately taken off the market. Since all cigarettes and other tobacco products are poisonous and potentially lethal, they should all be taken off the market. In short, smoking should be banned.|Yes|Cigarette makers should pay a price for creating harmful products.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11916|1390|corporate responsibility|1528| Smoking|As the proposition points out, cigarettes are not dangerous because they are defective; rather they are inherently, potentially, harmful. Cigarette companies are, therefore, not failing their consumers by producing cigarettes; the consumers are getting what they asked for. The individual's right to choose a certain effect is not being infringed upon, as it is when a certain good fails. Therfore, people should still be allowed to choose to buy and smoke them.|No|Cigarettes are very different from dangerous cars or poisonous foods:|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11917|1390|corporate responsibility|1528| Smoking|High cholesterol or a high intake of fat can be extremely harmful, leading to heart disease, obesity, and other conditions; but manufacturers of these products are not punished. Consumers simply like the taste of fatty food. People should be allowed to smoke cigarettes and to eat fatty foods - both these things are sources of pleasure which, while having serious associated health risks, are only fatal after many decades, unlike a poisonous food or an unsafe car, which pose immediate and high risks.|No|Many products are unhealthy; alienating cigarettes is unfair.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11918|41|feasibility|1528| Smoking|It would be unreasonable to criminalize an activity indulged in by about one sixth of the world population. The lesson of prohibition of alcohol in America in the 1920s was that banning a recreational drug used by a large proportion of the population merely leads to crime and contraband. It would also mean that governments would lose tax revenue from tobacco sales - a major source of income for national health and other resources in many countries.|No|Restricting smoking, done by billions of people, is unreasonable.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11919|1391|harming to others|1528| Smoking|In a smoke-filled environment, non-smokers (family members, colleagues, customers, etc.) are also exposed to the risks associated with tobacco. Research suggests that partners of smokers have an increased chance of developing lung cancer, even if they do not use tobacco products. It is estimated that passive smoking kills approximately 80 000 people in the EU alone every year. (Brussels estimates that 15% of all deaths in the EU could be attributed to smoking.) Beyond the health risks, smoke can also be extremely unpleasant in public spaces, in the workplace or in bars and restaurants. (Data indicates that almost 86% of EU citizens are in favor of a ban on smoking at work.) Smokers are therefore causing discomfort - as well as actual harm - to others. On top of the harm cause to the smokers themselves, this is surely enough reason to ban smoking.|Yes|Smoking forces others to 'passively smoking':|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11920|1391|harming to others|1528| Smoking|Few controlled studies having been carried out. At most, those who live with heavy smokers for a long period of time may have a very slightly increased risk of cancer.|No|"Evidence about ""passive smoking"" is dubious."|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11921|1391|harming to others|1528| Smoking|It is true that smoke-filled environments can be unpleasant for non-smokers, but there are reasonable and responsible ways around this - smoking rooms in offices and airports are an excellent example. Some bars and restaurants may choose to be non-smoking establishments, giving customers the choice to select their environment. Allowing people to make their own, adult decisions is surely always the best option. Restricting smoking in public places may sometimes be appropriate, banning it altogether would be excessive.|No|"""Passive smoking"" can be reduced without draconian restrictions."|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11923|1392|tobacco ads|1528| Smoking|There should be a ban on all tobacco advertising due to the knowledge of its ill effects.|Yes|Harm of cigarettes are cause enough for restrictions on ads.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11924|1392|tobacco ads|1528| Smoking|There is no good evidence that either of these measures would have an impact on the rate of tobacco consumption. Cigarette companies claim that advertisements are merely to persuade people to switch brands, not to start smoking in the first place. People start smoking through peer pressure - indeed the more of a 'forbidden fruit' cigarettes become, the more attractive they will be to adolescents. As for health warnings, if the knowledge that cigarettes have serious health risks deterred people from smoking then no-one would smoke any more. People start and continue to smoke in the full knowledge of the health risks.|No|Ads do not force people to smoke.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
11925|1393|tobacco anti-adverts|1528| Smoking|According to one of the largest neuromarketing studies ever conducted (see the book Buyology or its websites), adverts stating harmfulness of smoking and emphasizing health risks are in fact counterproductive - they effectively activate those parts of brain that trigger craving for cigarettes. And warning labels on cigarette packs are of no effect whatsoever.|No|Neuromarketing study claims these ads are counterproductive.|__UNKNOWN__|(__UNKNOWN__:1)
